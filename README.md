# 🎵 Welcome to SoundFlow

## Project info

SoundFlow is a personal music player project built with passion, curiosity, and a lot of vibecoding.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: I am not a professional developer.  
> Everything you see in this app has been created through experimentation, learning by doing, and pure vibecoding energy.

The main goal of SoundFlow is to provide a clean and functional music player experience, similar to classic music apps, with support for external sources (including Real Debrid), without ads or forced subscriptions.

## ✨ What is SoundFlow?

SoundFlow is designed to be:

- A simple and powerful music player  
- Free from advertising  
- Free from mandatory subscriptions  
- Compatible with external streaming/file sources  
- Focused on enjoying music with no distractions  

Just press play and enjoy your music 🎧

## ⭐ Premium Features

SoundFlow includes a few optional premium features.

These are **not meant to lock the app**, but only to help:

- Cover server and maintenance costs  
- Support ongoing development  
- Fund the iOS and Android APK versions (currently still in beta)  

The project is independent, and this is the only way to keep it sustainable.
